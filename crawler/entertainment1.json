Gellar told EW fans are so invested in the Angel vs. Spike debate that \"People ask who I thought was Buffy's ultimate and I get a lot of hate and a lot of death threats â€” seriously.\"\"There was something so beautiful to me about the Buffy and Angel story,\" Gellar said. \"I think that Spike understood a different part of who Buffy was and I think she needed to understand that and discover. But for me as Buffy, I think Angel.\"The show's creator Whedon had a tougher time choosing.\"I'm split right down the middle because in terms of a long-term relationship: Spike's kinda your guy because he actually went and got a soul because of her,\" Whedon said. \"But [Angel and Buffy] is the grandest love story I will ever tell. You can't argue with that.\""
